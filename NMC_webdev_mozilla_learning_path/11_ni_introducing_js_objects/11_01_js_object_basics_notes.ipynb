    "An **object** is a collection of related data and/or functionality. It usually consists of several variables and functions. The variables are called **properties** and the functions are called **methods**.  \n",

    "- object literals\n",
    "- classes  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Object properties and methods can be accessed using:\n",
    "- dot notation\n",
    "    - the object name acts as a namespace\n",
    "- square bracket notation\n",
    "    - this is why objects are sometimes called **associative arrays** (instead of using an integer index to access the element of the object, we use the name associated with the value of the element)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "It's useful to think of the way objects communicate as **message passing**: when object `A` needs object `B` to perform some kind of action, `A` uses one of its methods to send a message to `B` and waits for a response from it."
