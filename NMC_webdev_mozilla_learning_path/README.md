# Mozilla Learning Path

This is a collection of notes I take and mini-projects I work on while following the [Mozilla web development learning path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

### Notes
- I noticed today (04/14/21) that the [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) learning path skips several intermediate and advanced HTML and CSS sections listed in the sidebar menu for tutorials. I'll include these sections in my learning path (placeholder for now, to keep the correct number sequence, and I'll come back to them after done with the suggested learning path).

TO-DO:
- [ ] 01_getting_started_with_the_web
    - [ ] alternating indents to the poem
    - [ ] button to change pictures
