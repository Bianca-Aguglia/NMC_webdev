# Mozilla Learning Path

This is a collection of notes I take and mini-projects I work on while following the [Mozilla web development learning path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

### Notes
- I noticed today (04/14/21) that the [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) learning path skips the intermediate HTML and advanced HTML sections. I'll include them in my learning path (placeholder for now, to keep the correct number sequence, and coming back to it after done with the suggested learning path)

TO-DO:
- [ ] 01_getting_started_with_the_web
    - [ ] alternating indents to the poem
    - [ ] button to change pictures
